# Python-Pdf-to-audio
This project is a simple pdf converter (only pdf -> mp3 or wav)

this project isn't complete as I ran into some issues trying to save the file after being converted and there were some issues with trying to change the voice and speed at which the words are being read. Right now I have other projects and assignments to work on so I am benching this one if you guys have any use for this project by all means you can use it
